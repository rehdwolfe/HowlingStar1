This is a story of a girl named Georgia and her little sister Emmie, a boy named Noah, another boy named keiden and yet another boy named Knox.
It is also the story of seven magical totems that were found at the end of a very long day.  This may not mean what you think it does. 
That is often the case when magical items are involved. We apologize for any inconvenience. In this case, 'at the end of a very long day' 
doesn't mean that the aforementioned boys and girls had a very trying day, although they did, or that it was summer and the duration of the day 
was longer than usual, although it was, but instead that they had travelled through the halls of creation of a particular day quite by 
accident and found that they were travelling the distance of the constuction of a very long day. If you're confused, that may be 
evidence that you still retain some vestige of sanity. Again, we apologize for any inconvenience. Perhaps, we should start at the beginning.
